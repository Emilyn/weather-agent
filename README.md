   - Repeat for each secret you need to add

**Required Secrets** (add these first):

6. Add the following secrets one by one:

| Secret Name | Description | Example | Required |
|------------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `LOCATION_LAT` | Your latitude | `48.8566` | ✅ Yes |
| `LOCATION_LON` | Your longitude | `2.3522` | ✅ Yes |
| `NTFY_TOPIC` | Your unique Ntfy.sh topic | `weather_john_xyz789` | ✅ Yes |

| `OPENWEATHER_KEY` | OpenWeatherMap key | `xyz789...` | ⭐ Recommended |

**Note**: You need either `GROQ_API_KEY` or `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`. The optional weather API keys improve accuracy but the agent will work without them.

### 6. Enable GitHub Actions

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository (top navigation bar)
2. If you see a message about enabling workflows, click **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**
3. The workflow will now run automatically every day at 6 AM GMT+1

### 7. Run GitHub Actions (Manual Testing)

**Don't wait until tomorrow! Test it right now:**

#### Option A: Run from Actions Tab (Recommended)

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. In the left sidebar, click on **Daily Weather Notification** workflow
3. Click the **Run workflow** dropdown button (top right)
4. Select the branch (usually `main` or `master`)
5. Click the green **Run workflow** button
6. Wait ~30 seconds for it to complete
7. Check your phone for the notification! 📱

#### Option B: Check Workflow Status

After triggering a run:

1. You'll see a new workflow run appear in the list
2. Click on the run to see detailed logs
3. Watch it progress through:
   - ✅ Set up Python
   - ✅ Install dependencies

   - ✅ Send notification
4. If it shows a green checkmark ✅, it succeeded!
5. If it shows a red X ❌, click it to see error details

#### Option C: Automatic Scheduled Runs

Once enabled, the workflow runs automatically:
- **Schedule**: Every day at 6 AM GMT+1 (5 AM UTC)
- **No action needed**: Just wait for your morning notification!
- **Check history**: Go to Actions tab to see all past runs

## 📱 What You'll Receive

Every morning at 6 AM, you'll get a notification like this:

```
🌤️ Good Morning! Weather Report
===================================

📊 Next 10 Hours Summary:
   Temperature: 12°C - 18°C
   Conditions: Partly cloudy

👔 What to Wear:
Based on the forecast, I recommend wearing a light 
jacket or sweater. The temperature will be mild but 
may feel cool in the morning. No rain expected, so 
you can leave the umbrella at home!

⏰ Hourly Forecast:
  +0h: 12.0°C Partly cloudy
  +1h: 13.5°C Partly cloudy
  +2h: 15.0°C Mostly sunny
  +3h: 16.5°C Sunny
  +4h: 17.5°C Sunny
  +5h: 18.0°C Sunny
  +6h: 17.5°C Partly cloudy
  +7h: 16.0°C Partly cloudy
  +8h: 15.0°C Cloudy
  +9h: 14.0°C Cloudy

📡 Data from 5 sources (Reliability: 100%)
Sources: Open-Meteo, WeatherAPI, wttr.in
```

## ⚙️ Customization

### Change Notification Time

Edit `.github/workflows/weather-notification.yml`:

```yaml
schedule:
  # Change '0 5' to your desired UTC time
  # Current: 5 AM UTC = 6 AM GMT+1
  - cron: '0 5 * * *'
```

**Time Zone Conversion Examples**:
- 6 AM GMT+1 (Paris) = `0 5` (5 AM UTC)
- 7 AM EST (New York) = `0 12` (12 PM UTC)
- 8 AM PST (Los Angeles) = `0 16` (4 PM UTC)
- 6 AM JST (Tokyo) = `0 21` (9 PM UTC previous day)

Use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) to help with cron syntax.

### Adjust Forecast Hours

Edit `src/weather_sources.py` to change from 10 hours to your preference.

### Customize Notification Format

Edit `src/ai_recommender.py` in the `format_notification()` method.

## 🔧 Local Testing

Test the agent locally before deploying. See [docs/DEV_GUIDE.md](docs/DEV_GUIDE.md) for detailed setup instructions.

Quick test:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Create .env file with your API keys
cd src && python weather_agent.py
```

## 📊 How It Works

1. **GitHub Actions** triggers the workflow daily at your scheduled time
2. **Weather Sources** fetches data from 5 different APIs simultaneously
3. **Aggregation** calculates weighted median values for temperature, precipitation, wind, etc.
4. **Reflection Engine** evaluates data quality and identifies issues
5. **AI Recommender** generates clothing advice with iterative refinement
6. **Reflection Engine** evaluates recommendation quality and refines if needed
7. **Ntfy.sh** delivers the formatted notification to your phone

See [docs/DEV_GUIDE.md](docs/DEV_GUIDE.md) for architecture details and [docs/REFLECTION_PATTERN.md](docs/REFLECTION_PATTERN.md) for reflection pattern documentation.


## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Notification Not Received

1. Check your phone's Ntfy.sh app is running
2. Verify you're subscribed to the correct topic
3. Check GitHub Actions logs for errors
4. Ensure all required secrets are set correctly

### "Failed to fetch from at least 2 weather sources"

- At least 2 weather APIs must work for the agent to run
- Add optional API keys (WeatherAPI, OpenWeatherMap) for redundancy
- Check if any APIs are temporarily down

### AI Recommendation Failed

- Verify your Groq or Hugging Face API key is correct
- Check API rate limits haven't been exceeded
- The agent will fall back to rule-based recommendations

### GitHub Actions Not Running

**Workflow won't start:**
1. Ensure Actions are enabled: Go to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General** → Make sure "Allow all actions" is selected
2. Check the workflow file exists: `.github/workflows/weather-notification.yml`
3. Verify the workflow file syntax is correct (YAML format)
4. Check if you've added all required secrets (see step 5)

**Can't find "Run workflow" button:**
1. Make sure you're on the **Actions** tab
2. Click on the workflow name in the left sidebar first
3. The button should appear at the top right
4. If it's still missing, the workflow file might not exist yet

**Workflow runs but fails:**
1. Click on the failed run to see error logs
2. Check if all required secrets are set correctly
3. Verify your API keys are valid (not expired)
4. Check the logs for specific error messages
5. Common issues:
   - Missing secrets → Add them in Settings → Secrets
   - Invalid API keys → Regenerate and update secrets
   - Network errors → Usually temporary, try again

**Scheduled runs not happening:**
1. Verify the cron schedule is in UTC time (not your local time)
2. Check Actions tab for past runs (might have failed silently)
3. Ensure the repository is active (GitHub pauses workflows on inactive repos)
4. First scheduled run may take up to 24 hours to start

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- All API keys are stored as GitHub Secrets (encrypted)
- Weather data is fetched but not stored
- Notifications are sent directly to your phone
- No data is collected or shared with third parties
- Open source - audit the code yourself!
